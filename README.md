# Machine Learning-Based Deepfake Detection for Enhanced Media Integrity and Authentication

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting deepfake media content using machine learning techniques to enhance media integrity and authentication. With the growing threat of manipulated media, deepfake technology has the potential to deceive individuals, organizations, and even governments. Our solution leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to identify deepfake videos and images to ensure the authenticity of digital content.

## Key Features

- **Deepfake Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect deepfake videos and images with high accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves robust preprocessing techniques, including image and video normalization, frame extraction, and feature selection.
- **Model Training**: Implements deep learning models (such as CNNs and RNNs) to classify media as either real or fake.
- **Real-time Authentication**: Capable of real-time media integrity verification to prevent the spread of false information.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to be used across multiple platforms for easy integration into security systems and media verification tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Modeling**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transfer Learning

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   - To start the detection system:
     ```
     python detect_deepfake.py
     ```

## Usage

1. **Input Data**:
   - The model accepts videos or images in `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.jpg`, `.png` formats.
   
2. **Detection**:
   - Simply input the media file into the detection system, and it will return whether the media is real or a deepfake.

3. **Model Training**:
   - To train the model on a custom dataset, use the following command:
     ```
     python train_model.py --dataset /path/to/dataset
     ```

## File Descriptions

- **detect_deepfake.py**: Script for detecting whether a media file is real or a deepfake.
- **train_model.py**: Script to train the machine learning model on a given dataset.
- **model.h5**: Pre-trained model file for deepfake detection.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
- **dataset**: Folder containing the dataset for training the model (if applicable).
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, etc.
